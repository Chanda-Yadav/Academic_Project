Real Time Object Detection using Deep-Learning and OpenCv
Technology used in it are OpenCV and YOLO algorithm .
There is many pre-defined classes, in this we include DNN(DeepNeural Network) module for processing on images .
There is button system in it by which one can control which particular
class will get evaluated in the frame.
